# RandomForestRegression-ChEMBL

 During winter brea between fall 2020 and spring 2021, I made a powerpoint presentation (converted to pdf format) as a way of demonstrating my knowledge of how the random forest algorithm works. 
 
 References for presentation are included at the end of the pdf
 
 During winter break, I also watched the DataProfessor's youtube video on how he used random forest regression with scikit-learn on data from ChEMBL database to find drugs that can act on Acetylcholinesterase. The code included in this repo is from his Youtube/Github. 

 Code from:
  - "Data Professor"'s Youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV8e2g4IWQqK71bbzGDEI4Q
  - "Dataprofessor"'s Github: https://github.com/dataprofessor/code/tree/master/python
